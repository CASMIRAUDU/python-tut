# A Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
# Create tuple
fruits = ('Apples','Oranges','Grapes')
# Using a constructor
# fruits2 = tuple(('Apple','Oranges','Grapes'))
# Single value needs trailing comma
fruits2 = ('Apples')
# Get Value
print(fruits[1])
# Can't change value
fruits [0] = 'Pears'
# Delete tuple
del fruits2
# Get length
print (len(fruits))
